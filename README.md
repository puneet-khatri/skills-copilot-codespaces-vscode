- **What you'll learn**: How to install Copilot into a Codespace, accept suggestions from code, accept suggestions from comments.
- **What you'll build**: Javascript files that will have code generated by Copilot AI for code and comment suggestions.
- **Prerequisites**: To use GitHub Copilot you must have an active GitHub Copilot subscription. Sign up for 60 days free [Copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot).
- **Timing**: This course can be completed in under an hour.
